# variable and datatypes:
# a = 1
# b = 2.2
# c = 3
# print(a+b+c)
# python itself recognizes the datatype.
# a = 25
# b = a
# print(b)

# a = 10
# b = 10
# print(a == b)
# it will return boolean true or false

# Type() function defines the data type of the element:
# a = 2.1
# b = 2
# c = 'ali'
# print(type (a))
# print(type (b))
# print(type (c))
# result will be float:

# input() function used to take input from the user:
# Example:
# a = int(input("enter the value of a"))
# b = int(input("enter the value of b"))
# # result = a + b
# print("the sum of your numbers is :", a + b)
# int is used because the digits entered are considered as strings int converts them into integer:
